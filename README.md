Hacker Simulator Collection (Educational & Visual Only)

This repository contains a set of safe, non-malicious, movie-style hacker simulations built in Python.
They are designed for learning, fun, and practice, not for hacking anything in real life.

All scripts are visual simulations only — no real hacking, no network activity, no password attacks.

Projects Included
 1. Matrix Rain (matrix_rain.py)

A fullscreen terminal animation inspired by the classic Matrix rain effect.

Features:

Smooth falling green characters

Bright leading glyph with trailing stream

Works in any real terminal

Press Q to quit

Stable even on small screens

Tech: curses, Python standard library

 2. Fake Brute-Force Simulator (fake_bruteforce.py)

A dramatic visual-only brute-force simulation.
It displays rapidly changing random character attempts for learning purposes.

Features:

User inputs a fake “target”

Completely offline

No real password interaction

External stop via stop.txt

Ctrl+C support

Fun for animations and loops

Tech: Python standard library

3. Retro Hacker UI (retro_hacker_ui.py)

A classic retro terminal dashboard built with the curses library.

Features:

Multi-panel retro interface

Blinking headers

Animated data streaming

Handles window resizing

Full-screen text UI

Tech: curses, Python standard library

4. GUI Hacker Panel (hacker_panel_gui.py)

A Tkinter-based graphical “Hacker Control Panel” simulation.

Features:

Animated log output

Buttons and interactive widgets

System-style panels

Clean shutdown

Safe and visual-only

Tech: Tkinter, Python standard library

Installation & Running

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MulengaHankandaChituta/mulenga_hacker_simulations.git
cd mulenga_hacker_simulations


Run a script:

python3 matrix_rain.py


Run the GUI:

python3 hacker_panel_gui.py


Note: curses apps must be run in a real terminal (not IDLE, not VS Code Run button).

Safety Notice

These programs are:

✔ Educational

✔ Offline

✔ Visual-only

✔ Safe for beginners

✔ Good for practicing Python

They do not:

❌ Connect to networks

❌ Perform real brute-force attacks

❌ Access, modify, or hack systems

❌ Damage files

Everything stays inside your terminal.

Future Improvements

Add sound effects

More color themes

Cyberpunk animations

Fake network activity charts

PyQt/PySide GUI version
